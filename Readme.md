## Vision
ss:-
The **Achievement Badges** smart contract aims to create a system for issuing and verifying achievement badges on the Aptos blockchain. This system allows issuers, such as educators or organizations, to recognize and award achievements to students or participants in a transparent and immutable manner.

## Features

- **Issue Badge**:

  - Allows issuers to create and award badges to students.
  - Each badge includes a description of the achievement and is marked as issued.

- **Check Badge**:
  - Enables verification of whether a student has received a specific badge.
  - Retrieves the description of the badge if it has been issued.

## Future Scope

1. **Badge Revocation**:

   - Implement functionality to revoke or update badges if necessary.

2. **Multiple Badges**:

   - Support multiple badges per student with a more sophisticated management system.

3. **Badge Levels**:

   - Introduce different levels or categories of badges based on achievement complexity.

4. **Public Badge Display**:

   - Develop a feature to publicly display issued badges and achievements on a profile or portfolio.

5. **Integration with Education Platforms**:

   - Integrate with educational platforms or learning management systems to automate badge issuance based on performance or milestones.

6. **Custom Badge Designs**:
   - Allow for custom badge designs or metadata to enhance the recognition system.

The **Achievement Badges** contract provides a decentralized solution for awarding and verifying achievements, fostering a transparent and credible recognition system.
